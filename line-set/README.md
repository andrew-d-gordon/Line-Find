# Find Lines Through Points
This project serves as a library of code for finding lines that cross through a number of unique points from a set of 
input points. The driver code within find_lines.py utilizes the other modules within src/ in order to achieve it's 
line finding. It is best to set several flags which specify an input file and the threshold of how many points a line 
must cross through. More information on available functions, objects, and the line finding algorithm can be found in the 
[docs](https://github.com/andrew-d-gordon/coding-challenges/tree/main/line-set/docs) folder. The different line finding
functions are detailed within `finding_unique_lines()` and `finding_max_unique_lines()` sections inside of
[find_lines.md](https://github.com/andrew-d-gordon/coding-challenges/tree/main/line-set/docs/find_lines.md).

The unit_tests folder is home to various test files (many randomly generated by point_test_creator.py, others serve as 
basic tests). The format of these files is ideal because of how find_lines.py is set up to retrieve point sets from 
files (e.g. x1 y1\nx2 y2\nx3 y3\n). Also, test_find_lines.py in src is a script which utilizes the unittest library to 
run manual inputs as well as point set inputs from files in unit_tests/.

Here is an example of how to run the program from the command line using unit_tests/test_9_set_9 as input.

`python find_lines.py -t unit_tests/test_9_set_9 -p 3 -s 1 -g 1 -b 12`

* -t: specifies the name of the test file to pull point data from
* -p: specifies the point threshold to be reached
* -s: specifies restrictions on the set of lines returned
    * `-s 0` for set of unique lines that satisfy point threshold (these lines can have points in common)
    * `-s 1` for the largest number of lines which do not have any points in common. It is a subset of the set of unique
     lines which satisfy the given point threshold (the value given after -p)
    * Outputs using both `-s 0` and `-s 1` are shown below on test_9_set_9 (`-s 0` runs significantly faster)
* -g: specifies whether or not the results should be plotted (`-g 1` for graph desired, `-g 0` for no graph desired)
* -b: specifies the bounds which the output graph should have (b x b dimensions)

`If not all or none of the flags are supplied, default values are utilized to run the program instead.`
